/**
 * Shared engine for blocks whose blockstate properties are <em>derived from their neighbours</em>
 * rather than from the player: recomputed on placement and on every neighbour update, with the
 * choice of model pushed entirely into the blockstate JSON.
 *
 * <p>This class holds everything that does not depend on which axes a block scans: the
 * {@link Settings} record, the matching rules, the placement / update / self-heal hooks, and the
 * shape, occlusion and rendering behaviour. A concrete subclass only declares its
 * {@code static final} properties, adds them in {@code createBlockStateDefinition}, and
 * implements {@link #computeState}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Properties are declared per subclass, not per {@link Settings}, on purpose:
 * {@code createBlockStateDefinition} runs from inside the {@link Block} constructor, before any
 * subclass field is assigned, so a settings-driven property set would read {@code null}. Vanilla
 * splits {@code CrossCollisionBlock} / {@code FenceBlock} for the same reason. Everything that is
 * <em>not</em> a blockstate property still goes through {@link Settings}.</p>
 *
 * @see VerticalConnectedModelBlock  vertical runs (single / bottom / middle / top)
 * @see SideConnectedModelBlock      the four horizontal connections
 * @see LayeredSideConnectedModelBlock  the above, plus a per-floor model set
